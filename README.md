###
This work presents Lite Any Stereo. It is a super efficient stereo matching model with strong zero-shot generalization ability. It outperforms or match accuracy-oriented models that do not use foundational priors, while requiring less than 1% of their computational cost.

## Demo 
Several example stereo image pairs are provided in the `/assets/` directory. 

You can visualize zero-shot stereo matching results of Lite Any Stereo on real-world scenes by running:
```
python demo.py
```
You can also test the model on your own stereo image pairs by replacing the input images.

## Checkpoint
Before running the demo, please download the pretrained checkpoints from
 [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UvDx296pVk7pC2rozKIpQF_EXcOleZOB?usp=sharing) . 
Then place them in: `./checkpoints/`


## Benchmark Results 
To reproduce the benchmark results reported in Table 3 and Table 4 of the paper, run:
```
sh evaluate.sh
```
The results of [Lite-CREStereo++](https://github.com/TomTomTommi/LiteCREStereo_plusplus) can be reproduced here.

## MACs
To compute the model complexity (MACs), use:
```
python flops_count.py
```

##  Runtime
To measure the inference time, run:
```
python profile_speed.py
```
This script uses CUDA synchronization for more accurate latency measurement.
The initial version followed the evaluation practice of previous methods and reported runtime using `evaluate_stereo.py`
